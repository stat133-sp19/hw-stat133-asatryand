  The Golden State Warriors have recently captured everyone's attention in the basketball world. With "The Splash Brothers" at their peak, and a prominent Kevin Durant in addition as well, this team has shocked everyone. The following report will make an investigation of the statistics for the starting 5 of the Golden State Warriors team of the 2016 year. Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala all had an exceptional season, and their statistics will support this statement as evidence.

  Initially, let's begin by looking at the "Shot Charts: GSW (2016 Season)" image below. You can notice an individual graph of each player, where all their shots are mapped out, along with their location and whether the attempt was successful or not. You should be able to notice something right off the bat - the first step as to why Golden State Warriors became so successful and changed how basketball is played today. There is an undeniable similarity between all the areas where all players took shots from, which should not be the case in a regular NBA team. Regularly, Centers will be scoring within the paint - usually with layups, dunks, hook shots and etc. However, in the image below, you can see numerous shot attempts by Draymond Green (the Center for Golden State Warriors in the 2016 season) from the 3 point line! This interchangibility is what has been a major key to success in this team, the ability of every player to be able to play every position. This can be compared to FC Barcelona, a soccer club in Spain with their immensely unique style of play - Tiki Taka. With this style of pay, the ball is constantly moving between three interchangable players - while looking at a screen you would see triangle shapes all around. This type of play allows even DEFENDERS to come near the opponent's goal line and even score! Barcelona emphasizes the fact that any player should be able to play any position, and I believe Golden State Warriors began playing with the same mentality which allowed them to reach such success.
  
  The report will provide you with 4 pieces of data. First, you will be presented with the Shots Data of each player, as discussed above. This will provide you with a display of where each shot was taken, and whether the attempt resulted in additional points for the team or not. Keep in mind these statistics are only for 2 PT Field Goals and 3 PT Field Goals, meaning Free Throws are not included and not used for comparison. Following the display of the shots data, you will notice three data tables providing summaries. The first data table is a summary of 2 PT Field Goals for each player. Column 1 is a list of the names of the players who have been analyzed, column 2 is the total number of attempts they have made in 2 PT Field Goals, column 3 is the number of successful attempts, and column 4 is their conversion rate - how likely are they to score a 2 PT Field goalaccording to the data presented. A similar structured data is provided as well for 3 PT Field goals and one as well for the combination of both - total field goals of each player.
  
  Looking at the 3 PT field goal table, you can see that Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry lead the statistics with the highest conversion rates of 3 pointers - 42.4% & 40.8% respectively, rightfully entitling them to their nicknames - "The Splash Brothers" - which means that they are constantly scoring threes for their team. By looking at their attempts as well (the "total" column), you can see that they are two players entrusted with shooting the majority of threes. Steph and Klay together have attempted a total of 1267 3 Pt Field Goals, while Andre, Draymond and Durant have only attempted 665.
  
  In regards to 2 PT Field Goals, you can now see the other positions come into play. Andre Iguodala holds the highest 2 PT Field conversion, as this is his natural position - a small forward and sometimes a shooting guard when needed. Kevin Durant, one of the most versatile players currently in basketball, holds the most attempts for 2 PT Field Goals and the second highest conversion rate. This is a great explanation as to why he is an MVP Contender and a Hall of Famer - he is one of the best players to step on the court.
  
  Finally, you can notice the total points table, which takes into account all 2 PT and 3 PT Field Goals attempts by these 5 players. Unsurprisingly, you will notice Kevin Durant with the highest conversion rate, making 54.1% of all his shots, which is amazing by itself. It is completely understandable why Klay Thompson and Steph Curry are not on the top of this chart. Due to their positions and style of play, they are stuck shooting 3 pointers the majority of time (as you can see from the 3 PT Field goal table, they have the most attempts). 3 PT Field goals are understandably much harder to complete than 2 Pointers - especially dunks and layups, where you are right near the basket. Due to this, they have a lower conversion rate, but make no mistake, they have the highest scored points in the Golden State Warriors team.
  
  In summary, it is special to note the GSW style of play, with the interchangibility of each player. It is also clear to see that the "Splash Brothers" do indeed deserve the name that has been granted to them, with their shot attempts and their conversion rates. Kevin Durant is also an MVP contender, as a result of his versatility.
