The following homework involves an in-depth analysis of the Golden State Warriors starting 5 (Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala and Steph Curry).

By taking into account all shots taken by these players, including information such as where and when these shots were taken, the homeworks allows us to create shot charts of each player, providing summaries and summarizations of the strengths and weaknesses of their abilities.

The purpose of this assignment is to:
  1) Start working with more complex file structures, including uploading files to GitHub
  2) Visualizing shots data of 5 NBA players
  3) Creating a report and summary of the conclusion, that will provide a narrative to all this data.
